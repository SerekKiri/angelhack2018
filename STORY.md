# Docugram
Docugram is an application that simplifies the process of administration, verification and archivisation in varius places.

**Docugram can replace most of your ordinary paperwork without even wasting one sheet of paper.**

## Interface 
The system consists of three main elements
- Template editor
- Workflow editor
- Native mobile app

Each of these parts serves a different purpose. **Template Editor** allows user to easily design their own Form Layout, and **WorkFlow Editor** makes your ordinary forms smarter, allowing you to program thier behaviour depending on your target audience's actions. Thanks to our graphical draggable interface, anyone can use this system. 
Over 77% people in the world have smartphones. Our **mobile app** allows your consumers to fill out your documents from anywhere in the world. The only thing they need is their mobile phone and the link you provide them. Its even easier than filling piece of paper!

## Initial target
We got our inspiration by seeing a lot of paper being wasted in our schools. We want to target private school institutions, where their owners pay a lot of money for additional employees and services or add extra work for teachers who're already busy.
We would bill per active groups of users in current institution. We would on the costs on individual basis.
At the same time, its easy to scale for other markets later.
